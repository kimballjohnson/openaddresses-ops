**Finding 27 million rooftops—hands on with Mapzen Search and OpenAddresses**

[March 2 2016, Bill Morris](http://blog.faraday.io/finding-27-million-addresses-hands-on-with-mapzen-search-and-openaddresses/)

> That’s when we turned to the OpenAddresses project, and Mapzen’s excellent API exposure of it. With some help from their engineers and a batch-reverse-geocoding library we wrote, we were able to tag more than 20 million of our rooftop records with valid, formatted, current addresses. We couldn’t have done any better by driving a fleet of cars around with cameras and GPS units.



**OpenAddresses now has 220 million points**

[February 12 2016, Tom Lee](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/openaddresses-220m/)

> That was fast: OpenAddresses now contains 220 million addresses. You might recall that the project began in 2015 with 100 million points. It’s been growing steadily since, adding an average of about three hundred thousand addresses per day(!). It’s an incredible milestone for a project that only turned two years old earlier this month.



**OpenAddresses: 130 Million Addresses, Building Momentum**

[July 20 2015, Michal Migurski](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/07/20/openaddresses-130-million-addresses-building-momentum-2/)

> There’s been incredible momentum recently on the OpenAddresses project. As of now, we have opened more than 130 million addresses in nearly a dozen countries, 10 million more since our last update. Those addresses have come from 650 datasets, with a total of 70 people contributing to the project.



**OpenAddresses: Building a useful dataset out of disparate datasets**

> Addresses are the big missing puzzle piece in open geospatial data, OpenAddresses aims to provide that puzzle piece.
> 
> OpenAddresses is a dataset of geocoded addresses from around the world collected from hundreds of original sources. It started out as a list of data in the United States and has grown into a Github project with dozens of contributors, an automatic build system, and a collection of over 110 million addresses. Learn how to find and collate this data, where we plan to take it, and how you can help grow open address data!



**Creating an Open Database of Addresses**

[March 27 2015, Coleman McCormick](https://medium.com/@colemanm/creating-an-open-database-of-addresses-73a7d0dc24c5)

> One of the coolest open source / open data projects happening right now is OpenAddresses, a growing group effort assembling around the problem of geocoding, the process of turning human-friendly addresses into spatial coordinates (and its reverse). I’ve been following the project for close to a year now, but it seems to have really gained momentum in the last 6 months.



**OpenAddresses Hits 100 Million**

[January 9 2015, Tom Lee](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/openaddresses-100m/)

> OpenAddresses is starting 2015 with a bang: all together, OpenAddresses now contains more than 100 million address points! It was just last June that we celebrated collecting 30 million addresses. The project’s growth has only accelerated since then.
> 
> It’s been particularly exciting to watch OpenAddresses expand beyond the US. There are plenty of national and regional governments that either publish open data or are preparing to. We’ve been surprised to find how effective simply asking a government about open data can be. In Australia alone it uncovered about 2.7 million addresses.



**Announcing an OpenAddresses Bounty**

[August 1 2014, Waldo Jaquith](https://usopendata.org/2014/08/01/openaddresses/)

> At the US Open Data Institute, we’re big fans of OpenAddresses. They’re working to piece together a address-level map of the entire world, county by county, city by city, town by town. Here in the United States, that data is often published on municipalities’ websites. (For example, see Baltimore, Albuquerque, or Atlanta.) Stitching together this data will ultimately create a map of every addressable property in the country, as entirely open data, which is essential fuel for innovation.

**30 Million Open Addresses Mapped**

[June 23 2014, Aaron Lidman](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/30-million-addresses/)

> OpenAddresses is amazing data for geocoding and map making. We wanted to make a map of all 30 million addresses to get an idea of how much coverage there already is and which areas are missing. What we found was a variety of artistic patterns of dots that describe neighborhoods and cities.
